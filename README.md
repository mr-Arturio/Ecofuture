For translate the pages there are two installed plugins:

1. GTranslate - nice looking support as many languages as possible - but only Google Translates, you can not edit translations.
2. TranslatePress - only two languages in free version, but you can edit translation (actualy in en to uk case you need manualy type all the translations)
